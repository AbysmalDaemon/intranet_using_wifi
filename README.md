## Intranet Using WiFi

I have hosted a Webserver which can be accessed by people connected to the same WiFi. Local IPs will be assigned to each of the new connected devices which login to the webserver. We can then use these local IP Addresses (IP Addresses are assigned w.r.t. the order they login to the webserver) to send personalized data to the individual in question. To send data, use the serial monitor and use the syntax:
#### LocalIPAddress$DataYouWantToSend
Using a NodeMCU ESP8266 and a public/home WiFi you will be able to create your own mini intranet system!
